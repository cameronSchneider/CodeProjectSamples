## Project Descriptions

### _Bank Account Final Project:_
	
This is a very simple command line project done in Fall 2017 for an Intro to Programming course. It is a type of application that a bank teller would use to add, edit, remove, and check up on client accounts. This project is included here because it is my starting point in my programming journey.

To run the project, you will require an ID and a Password (located in data\tellers.dat), but for examples purposes use:

User: o-fritz

Pass: happy

### _"Final Project":_
	
I could not change the name of this directory, but it is a Unity game built for my Game Technology I course in Spring 2018. For the final project, we were given 2 weeks to concept and develop a basic prototype of a 2D game. I set myself a massive challenge in that I wanted to learn and implement some of Unity's built-in Networking libraries and assets. I learned and roughly implemented UNET libraries and assets to create a networked game that can be successfully played using P2P methods.

After project completion, I left it as it was. I am extremely proud of what I was able to get done in such a short amount of time, and this is the result exactly as I left it. The game itself is located in _Running Project\Test3.exe_. The source code is located in _Source Project\Assets\Scripts_.
