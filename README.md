*Project Descriptions*

_Bank Account Final Project:_
	
This is a very simple command line project done in Fall 	2017 for an Intro to Programming course. It is a type of 	application that a bank teller would use to add, edit, 	remove, and check up on client accounts. This project is 	included here because it is my starting point in my 	programming journey.

To run the project, you will require an ID and a Password (located in data\tellers.dat, but for examples purposes use:

User: o-fritz
Pass: happy

_"Final Project":_
	
I could not change the name of this directory, but it is 	is a Unity game built for my Game Technology I course in 	Spring 2018. For the final project, we were given 2 weeks 	to concept and develop a basic prototype of a 2D game. I 	set myself a massive challenge in that I wanted to learn 	and implement some of Unity's built-in Networking 	libraries and assets. I learned and roughly implemented 	UNET libraries and assets to create a networked game that 	can be successfully played using P2P methods.
