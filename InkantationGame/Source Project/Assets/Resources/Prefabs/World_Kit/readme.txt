Tiling textures is based on units

The width of a texture is based on the "pixels per unit" which is 100ppu by defualt

To find how many "tiles" needed divide the width of the image by 100. Then divide the width of the object you are applying the texture to by that number

If you want to change something that isn't a public variable or the transform of an object (size, position, rotation) please don't
